I CANNOT OLD SONGS
SING THE '
I cannot sing the old songs
I sang long years ago, And yet I cannot say I’m
sad That time hath changed
us so, For when I used to sing
.those songs, My Papa
blanked, And Mamma took me on
her knee And I, alas! was spanked.

A LITTLE
LOVE
I
“Oh, W'inter Land,” he
said, “Thy right to be I own, God leaves thee not alone, And if the fierce Winds
blow O’er thy wastes of rock and
snow, And at thy iron gates, 'Thy ghostly iceberg waits, Thy homes and hearts are
dear, God’s love and man’s are
here.

II
“Thy sorrow o’er the sa-
cred dust, Is sanctified by hope and
trust, Still, whereso’er it goes, Love makes its atmos-
phere; Its flowers of Paradise, Take root in the eternal ice, And bloom through polar
snows.”

TWO LITTLE BEARS
I
Two little cub—bears, Frisky and strong, - Hair brown and shaggy,
Claws sharp and long. g
II
Two little cub-bears In a child’s breast, Fawn-like and gentle,
Bringing us rest.

BOOK OF VERSES
III
In the green grass rolling,
Snapping their jaws, Now standing upright, Licking their paws.
IV
Why, how can that be? ' Not strange you stare, Where was there ever
A gentle bear?
V
Two little cub-bears In a child’s breast, Called bear and forbear,
They bring us rest.

A LITTLE
A GOLDEN HAIR
Only a golden hair
Found on my coat to-day, Why should my lady stare, Why wear an injured air,
Why should she say, “Love, we must sever, Farewell, forever”?
Curses on that golden hair Found on my coat to-day! However came it there, By means of foul or fair,
I cannot say; But this, I know, alack! .My lady’s hair is black!

THE APPROACH OF THANKSGIVING
There is a dawning in the
sky Which doth a world of fate
imply, And on each casual passing
face A look expectant you may
trace. These signs the veteran
turkey sees, And with a deep and
mournful sigh, He calls his numerous
family nigh, And murmurs, pointing to
the trees, “Roost high, my little
ones, roost high!”

A LITTLE
BABY AND I
Baby and I, in the twilight
sweet, Hearing the weary birds
repeat Cheery good-nights from
tree to tree, Dearest of all day’s com-
fort see;
For weary, too, We kiss and coo, He gives up all his world
for me.
Baby and I, in the twilight
glow, Watching the branches to
and fro,

BOOK OF VERSES
Waving good—nights to the
golden west, Welcome the hour we love
the best;
We rock and sing, Till sleep we bring, Who folds him in her
downy nest.
Lingering still in the twi-
light grey, After the radiance fades
away, I watch my darling, so still,
so fair, With thankful heart that to
my care,
For happiness No words express, Awhile God trusts a gift so
dear.

ATMOSPHERIC ' DE- CEPTION
The shades of night were
falling fast As through the streets of
Denver pass’d An Englishman who raised
on high This feeble but suggestive
cry,
“The Foothills.”
He queried of a man he met “How far unto the Foot-
hills yet ?” ' i The man looked up and
deeply sighed, “Some thirty miles, sir,” he
replied,
“To them Foothills.”
